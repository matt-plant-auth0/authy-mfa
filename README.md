# Custom Push MFA using Authy
This is based off the React sample application, with the custom Authy MFA triggered from a button on the 'Profile' page. The button simply calls the 'getAccessTokenWithPopup' method passing the 'create:transaction' scope - an Action (code found in the 'tenant' folder) checks for this (and the fake transaction value) and triggers the Authy Push if necessary. All transaction related data (as well as the Authy user ID which I've obfuscated as it is specific to my user - you'll need to create one in your own Twilio Authy application) is stored in the user's app_metadata, with an example of this object also in the 'tenant' folder.

You'll also notice the use of a 'AUTHY_API_KEY' environment variable - this is declared in my '.env' file as it is technically a secret, and can be found in your Twilio Authy application dashboard.

This testing app is currently configured to run locally using certificates from https://local.a0.gg (which is a DNS record pointing at 127.0.0.1) - as such, you'll need to change any hardcoded references to the URL in this app and the Actions code (found in the 'tenant' folder), plus modify how the 2 servers start because they reference the SSL certs.
